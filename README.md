# FYP-Mewan

This was my Final Year Project for my BSc in I.T.
It uses Vision and CoreML to detect objects/text and the uses the Microsoft Azure Translation API to provide Malay translations for the word/object detected to display in the Augmented Reality Scene. 
A test mode is available for users that wish to test their knowledge of the language.
